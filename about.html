    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>Way way back in the day, there was a guy named
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">_why</a>. He created a
    project known as <a href="http://hackety-hack.com">Hackety Hack</a> to teach
    programming to everyone. In order to reach all corners of the earth,
    _why decided to make Hackety Hack work on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
    This was a lot of work, and so _why decided to share his toolkit with
    the world. Thus, Shoes was born.</p>

    <p>Everybody loved Shoes. Many apps were made, and put into
    The Shoebox, which no longer exists. But, one day, _why left.
    In his memory, Team Shoes assembled, and carried on making Shoes. They
    released Shoes 3 in late summer 2010.</p>

    <h2>Shoes 3.2</h2>
    <p>
    Shoes 3.0 and Shoes 3.1 (policeman) fell into neglect and stopped keeping pace with
    changes in Linux, OSX, Windows and MRI Ruby. Shoes 3.2 (aka federales) restarted Shoes 3 (MRI Ruby)
    so Red Shoes can run on 2015 versions of Linux, Windows, OSX and Ruby.  It fixed
    some very old and debilitating bugs and adds some spiffy features that <b>bare metal</b> or MRI users may like.
    </p>
    <h2>Shoes 4</h2>

    <p>Shoes 4 is a total re-write of Shoes. It's being done in JRuby with best practices. 
    It re-implements the original Shoes 3 definition of Shoes in a pure Ruby friendly way
    whereas Shoes 3.x is more difficult for Rubyists to modify since it has C and Objective-C 
    components and a build process that is <i>less than easy to understand.</i> 
    Shoes 3.2 also has hardware costs and web hosting costs which makes if difficult
    for many developers to duplicate.
    
    <p>Shoes 4 uses modern Ruby practices and tools and has spawned
    a few related projects:</p> 

    <p>ShoesSpec: An executable specification for Shoes implementations, so that
    others can co-exist. A few other Shoes projects exist already, and a
    unified interface will be great.</p>

    <p>Shoes-mocks: Sort of the opposite, a dummy
    set of Shoes that you can use to test applications written in Shoes.</p>

    <p>The website: A new website is being made as well. Help here would be just
    as awesome as work on Shoes itself.</p>
