<em>2017/11/12</em>

[The first release candidates for Shoes 4 (4.0.0.rc1)](https://rubygems.org/gems/shoes/versions/4.0.0.rc1) is up on
Rubygems! Go ahead and grab it with:

    gem install shoes --pre

After literally years of work by dozens of people, the first release candidate
for Shoes 4.0 is up!

What's new in the release? Scrolling is at long last supported on slots, a few
other bugs got squashed, and most importantly we have a new logo! Grab the gem
to take a look, or peek at https://github.com/shoes/shoes4/pull/1507 for pics.

We'll see how feedback goes post-RubyConf for the rc. We expect to tighten up
a few things and patch a few corners before a full release, but look for the
big 4.0 sometime soon!
