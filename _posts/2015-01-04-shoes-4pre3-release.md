Howdy Shoes fans!

[A new pre-release version
(4.0.0.pre3)](https://rubygems.org/gems/shoes/versions/4.0.0.pre3) is up on
Rubygems! Install with this simple command:

    gem install shoes --pre

Last time around we split the `shoes` gem into a couple different pieces. Well,
that work has continued and we *think* we've got the structure finalized!
There were a few big motivations in doing this.

First off, the name `shoes-dsl` was a bit restrictive to the purpose of the
gem, so we renamed it `shoes-core`.  This gem represents all the primary shared
functionality of shoes--the DSL, the backend selection, anything a new backend
implementation would need to get running.

The Shoes manual has been extracted to `shoes-manual` for use in contexts (like
our website) which don't need all of Shoes. It has all the content and the
Shoes code for optionally running the manual. Along those lines the syntax
highlighter we've inherited from Hackety-Hack is in `shoes-highlighter` now to
ease the way for upgrading or replacing in the future.

A new `shoes-package` gem has been spun up to hold, you guessed it, packaging
logic. This lets us easily exclude unneeded packaging code and dependencies
from packaged apps, keeping them as trim as possible.

Last but certainly not least, the `shoes` gem has had a change in purpose--it
is now a "meta-gem" that has no code of its own. This gem simply represents
the default installation of Shoes and nothing else. Any code that would be
sharable belongs in `shoes-core` instead.

Huge thanks to everyone who helped out with this release. \o/ &lt;3
