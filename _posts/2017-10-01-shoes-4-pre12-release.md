[A new pre-release version
(4.0.0.pre12)](https://rubygems.org/gems/shoes/versions/4.0.0.pre12) is up on
Rubygems! Go ahead and grab it with:

    gem install shoes --pre

A short bug fix release tightening up before some exciting Shoes news later
this year. What's the news? This should be the final preview release before we
declare a release candidate on Shoes 4!

To go with the big releases, Shoes will also get a spot on the stage at
RubyConf with the talk ["A New Pair of Shoes"](http://rubyconf.com/program#session-220).
